What is Malware Packer?
->For many years, packers were used for completely innocent reasons. Often known as a “runtime packer,” this software compresses files and then unpacks itself
  when a program or file is ready to be executed. 
->As technology advanced, this kind of file size compression became less of a necessity. Nonetheless, packers are still used today, primarily for malware 
  files.
->A malware packer is a tool used to mask a malicious file. Packers can encrypt, compress or simply change the format of a malware file to make it look like
  something else entirely. The process of packer compression or encryption takes the file from its original code to a new state using tried-and-true obfuscation 
  techniques. 
->As a result, malware can remain in a system undetected by antivirus software, anti-malware products and other security software, harming the integrity of your
  system and the security of your data. This is why it is so important to understand how packers can be used in malware. 
  
Most popular packers used in malware today are:
 
 1. UPX:
 •	UPX is short for the “Ultimate Packer for Executables.” It uses an open-source algorithm that does not require any additional system memory for decompression.
 •	UPX uses a data compression algorithm called UCL, which is an open-source implementation of portions of the proprietary NRV (Not Really Vanished) algorithm.UCL 
    been designed to be simple enough that a decompressor can be implemented in just a few hundred bytes of code. UCL requires no additional memory to be allocated for 
    decompression, a considerable advantage that means that a UPX packed executable usually requires no additional memory.
 •	UPX supports two mechanisms for decompression: an in-place technique and extraction to temporary file.
    (a)	The in-place technique, which decompresses the executable into memory, is not possible on all supported platforms. It has the advantage of being more efficient 
        in terms of memory, and that the environment set up by the OS remains correct.
    (b)	The rest uses extraction to temporary file. This procedure involves additional overhead and other disadvantages; however, it allows any executable file format 
        to be packed. The extraction to temporary file method has several disadvantages:
            (i)	Special permissions are ignored, such as suid.
            (ii)	argv[0] will not be meaningful.
            (iii)	Multiple running instances of the executable are unable to share common segments.
            
 2. The Enigma Protector:
 •	Like most packers, The Enigma Protector is marketed for individuals and businesses who want to protect their files from hacking. Nonetheless, The Enigma Protector 
    is commonly used to obfuscate malware.
 •	The Enigma Protector includes a wide range of unique features aimed at protecting executable files from illegal copying, hacking, modification, and analysis.
 •	The supported formats include almost all types of 32- and 64-bit executable files (exe, src, dll, ocx, bpl, etc.) and .NET files created using various development 
    tools, such as MS Visual Studio C#/C++/VB/VB.NET, Borland Delphi/C++, FreePascal, MASM, TASM and others. 
 •	The Enigma Protector will make your software resistant to cracking, and thus will increase your sales. The use of attack-proof cryptoalgorithms for registration 
    key generation will make it impossible for others to reconstruct or reproduce the registration key generator for your software. Various methods of code obfuscation,
    mutation and virtualization will help protect your application from hacking, modifying, disassembling, illegal retrieval of unique functions and data, etc.
    
 3. MPRESS:
 •	MPRESS was originally designed to compress files and decrease application start times. While this free software is extremely useful for regular file compression, 
    it is also easily accessible to hackers and other malware writers.
 •	MPRESS is a free, high-performance executable packer for PE32/PE32+/.NET/MAC-DARWIN executable formats
 •	MPRESS makes programs and libraries smaller, and decrease start time when the application loaded from a slow removable media or from the network. 
 •	It uses in-place decompression technique, which allows to decompress the executable without memory overhead or other drawbacks.
 •	It also protects programs against reverse engineering by non-professional hackers. Programs compressed with MPRESS run exactly as before, with no runtime 
    performance penalties.
    
 4. ExeStealth:
 •	ExeStealth is a tool that encrypts files to avoid detection and hacking. Designed by WebToolMaster, this free software is simple to implement and one of the best 
    anti-hacking tools on the market, which also makes it effective at hiding malware code in your system.
 •	It is a lightweight Windows application designed to help users protect their executable files against reverse engineering or cracking processes.
 •	It boasts a clean and straightforward interface that allows users to perform most operations with just a few clicks.
 
 5. Morphine:
 •	Unlike most other packers, Morphine includes its own PE loader, allowing users to encrypt the output of compressed data. 
 •	The polymorphic engine is also used to create completely unique decryptors for malware.
 
 6. Themida:
 •	Themida was developed by Oreans to protect Windows applications from hackers. Unfortunately, it can also be used to encrypt malicious files and complicate attempts
    to reverse-engineer malware.
 •	Themida uses the SecureEngine  protection technology that, when running in the highest priority level, implements never seen before protection techniques to
    protect applications against advanced software cracking.
 •	SecureEngine defeats all current cracking tools that can be used against protected applications and it will make sure that your protected applications are only run
    in safe environments.
    
 7. MEW:
 •	MEW is primarily used for smaller malware file compression using the LZMA algorithm. 
 •	Even though it was designed for small files, it has been updated over time so that it can also obfuscate larger malware files.
 •	It is an EXE compression tool that was specifically designed to handle small files, but does a pretty good job when working with larger files too.
 
 8. FSG:
 •	The free, simple FSG software compresses both small and large files. While it is popular and commonly used to hide malware code, it is also 
    relatively simple to unpack through a decompression loop that writes the data to the final destination.
    
 9. PESpin:
 •	Packer.PESpin is a Packer. Software used to compress user file to save disk space and often used to compress trojans and worms to hide from detection.
 •	PESpin compresses Windows code using MASM. It protects files against patching and disassembling, making it a popular resource for malware authors.
 
 10. Andromeda: 
 •	While Andromeda refers to a botnet that has been around since 2011, it is also a custom packer. Custom packers are especially dangerous because they are not as 
    simple to reverse-engineer.
 •	Andromeda is one of the longest running and most prevalent malware families to have existed. Andromeda was first discovered in late 2011 and it probably evolved 
    from ngrBot/DorkBot. 
 •	Throughout its existence, the groups behind Andromeda have used various methods to spread the malware and infect users.
 •	Andromeda spread via spam email campaigns with infected files attached (doc, xls, pdf, zip.), through illegal download sites, warez (infected cracks, keygens, ..),
    or infecting users via other phishing campaigns.
    
 11. VMProtect:
 •	VMProtect is very popular, as it can encrypt a wide range of files, including executable files, drivers and dynamic-link libraries. When an application encrypted 
    by VMProtect is opened, the packer does not decrypt anything; instead, it runs on a virtualized code.
 •	Code virtualization is the next step in software protection. Most protection systems encrypt the code and then decrypt it at the application’s startup. VMProtect 
    doesn’t decrypt the code at all! Instead, the encrypted code runs on a virtual CPU that is markedly different from generic x86 and x64 CPUs as the command set 
    is different for each protected file.
 •	VMProtect allows the generation and verification of serial numbers. Both manual and automatic generation are supported. Serial numbers can be limited by time or 
    date and locked to the hardware, while the free upgrade period can also be limited. VMProtect ensures it is physically impossible to run code without a serial 
    number.
    
 12. Obsidium:
 •	Obsidium works for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows applications. This software is capable of encrypting, compressing, and obfuscating malware.
 •	It is a feature-rich professional software protection and licensing system that was designed as a cost effective and easy to implement, yet reliable and 
    non-invasive way to protect your 32- and 64-bit Windows software applications and games from reverse engineering, unauthorized modifications ("cracking") and 
    redistribution ("software piracy") while providing a secure and flexible licensing/registration system.
    
 13. Exe Packer 2.300:
 •	Exe Packer 2.300 is a standard, free software for file compression and decompression. Since it has been around for years, Exe Packer 2.300 is one of the most 
    popular packers for malicious file obfuscation.
 •	EXE Packer 2.300 is a freeware tool that can compress and decompress executable files and DLL-files.
 •	There are 12 different levels for file-compression in Alternate EXE Packer. This program is also able to create backups of the files that shall be compressed. If 
    a file is compressed, the physical file size is reduced. A compressed file decompresses itself while being executed and can be used without this program.
