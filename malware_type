What is a Malware?
 • Malware, short for malicious software, is a program or code that is used to disrupt computer’s normal operation.
 
 Types of Malware:
 
 1. Virus: A virus is a piece of code that inserts itself into an application and executes when the app is run. Once inside a network, a virus may be used to
    steal sensitive data, launch DDoS attacks or conduct ransomware attacks.
   
    Infects: Usually spread via infected websites, file sharing, or email attachment downloads, a virus will lie dormant until the infected host file or
    program is activated. Once that happens, the virus is able to replicate itself and spread through your systems.
 
 2. Worm: Worms target vulnerabilities in operating systems to install themselves into networks. They may gain access in several ways: through backdoors built
    into software, through unintentional software vulnerabilities, or through flash drives. Once in place, worms can be used by malicious actors to launch DDoS 
    attacks, steal sensitive data, or conduct ransomware attacks.

    Infects: Worms are spread via software vulnerabilities or phishing attacks.
    
 3. Trojan horse: A Trojan disguises itself as desirable code or software. Once downloaded by unsuspecting users, the Trojan can take control of victims’ systems
    for malicious purposes. Trojans may hide in games, apps, or even software patches, or they may be embedded in attachments included in phishing emails. 
   
    Infects: Disguises itself as a legitimate file and because it looks trustworthy, users download it thereby infecting his system.
 4. Spyware: Spyware collects information about users’ activities without their knowledge or consent. This can include passwords, pins, payment information 
    and unstructured messages.
    The use of spyware is not limited to the desktop browser: it can also operate in a critical app or on a mobile phone.

    Infects: Spyware is a common threat, usually distributed as freeware or shareware that has an appealing function on the front end with a covert mission running in 
    the background that you might never notice. It’s often used to carry out identity theft and credit card fraud.
 5. Ransomware: Ransomware is software that uses encryption to disable a target’s access to its data until a ransom is paid. The victim organization is rendered
    partially or totally unable to operate until it pays, but there is no guarantee that payment will result in the necessary decryption key or that the
    decryption key provided will function properly..
    
    Infects: It often spread through phishing emails that contain malicious attachments or through drive-by downloading.
 7. Adware: Adware tracks a user’s surfing activity to determine which ads to serve them. Although adware is similar to spyware, it does   not install any 
    software on a user’s computer, nor does it capture keystrokes.
    The danger in adware is the erosion of a user’s privacy — the data captured by adware is collated with data captured, overtly   or covertly, about the 
    user’s activity elsewhere on the internet and used to create a profile of that person which includes who their friends are, what they’ve purchased, where
    they’ve traveled, and more. That information can be shared or sold to advertisers without the user’s consent.
    
    Infects: Bad apps are malicious apps that can install malware on your device. Similar to a computer, you can get adware through a browser vulnerability
    that can allow pop-ups ads. When a bad app is infected with adware, you can be bombarded by persistent ads.
  8. Rootkit:A rootkit is software that gives malicious actors remote control of a victim’s computer with full administrative privileges. Rootkits can be
     injected into applications, kernels, hypervisors, or firmware. They spread through phishing, malicious attachments, malicious downloads, and compromised 
     shared drives. Rootkits can also be used to conceal other malware, such as keyloggers.
    
    Infects: Rootkits typically infect computers via phishing email, fooling users with a legitimate-looking email that actually contains malware, but sometimes
    they can be delivered through exploit kits.  
  9. Keyloggers: A keylogger is a type of spyware that monitors user activity. Keyloggers have legitimate uses; businesses can use them to monitor employee
     activity and families may use them to keep track of children’s online behaviors.
     However, when installed for malicious purposes, keyloggers can be used to steal password data, banking information and other sensitive information. 
     Keyloggers can be inserted into a system through phishing, social engineering or malicious downloads.
    
     Infects: A software keylogger is put on a computer when the user downloads an infected application. Once installed, the keylogger monitors the keystrokes on the  
     operating system you are using, checking the paths each keystroke goes through.  
 10. Bots or Botnets: A bot is a software application that performs automated tasks on command. They’re used for legitimate purposes, such as indexing
     search engines, but when used for malicious purposes, they take the form of self-propagating malware that can connect back to a central server.
     Usually, bots are used in large numbers to create a botnet, which is a network of bots used to launch broad remotely-controlled floods of attacks, such 
     as DDoS attacks. Botnets can become quite expansive. For example, the Mirai IoT botnet ranged from 800,000 to 2.5M computers.

     Infects: One of the most common ways in which bots infect your computer is via downloads. Malware is delivered in download format via social media or email 
     messages that advise clicking a link. The link is often in picture or video form, with either containing viruses and other malware.
