What is a Malware?
 • Malware, short for malicious software, is a program or code that is used to disrupt computer’s normal operation.
 
 Types of Malware:
 
 1. Virus: A virus is a piece of code that inserts itself into an application and executes when the app is run. Once inside a network, a virus may be used to
    steal sensitive data, launch DDoS attacks or conduct ransomware attacks.
   
    Infects: Usually spread via infected websites, file sharing, or email attachment downloads, a virus will lie dormant until the infected host file or
    program is activated. Once that happens, the virus is able to replicate itself and spread through your systems.
 
 2. Worm: Worms target vulnerabilities in operating systems to install themselves into networks. They may gain access in several ways: through backdoors built
    into software, through unintentional software vulnerabilities, or through flash drives. Once in place, worms can be used by malicious actors to launch DDoS 
    attacks, steal sensitive data, or conduct ransomware attacks.

    Infects: Worms are spread via software vulnerabilities or phishing attacks.
    
 3. Trojan horse: A Trojan disguises itself as desirable code or software. Once downloaded by unsuspecting users, the Trojan can take control of victims’ systems
    for malicious purposes. Trojans may hide in games, apps, or even software patches, or they may be embedded in attachments included in phishing emails. 
   
    Infects: Disguises itself as a legitimate file and because it looks trustworthy, users download it thereby infecting his system.
 4. Spyware: Spyware collects information about users’ activities without their knowledge or consent. This can include passwords, pins, payment information 
    and unstructured messages.
    The use of spyware is not limited to the desktop browser: it can also operate in a critical app or on a mobile phone.

    Infects: Spyware is a common threat, usually distributed as freeware or shareware that has an appealing function on the front end with a covert mission running in 
    the background that you might never notice. It’s often used to carry out identity theft and credit card fraud.
 5. Ransomware: Ransomware is software that uses encryption to disable a target’s access to its data until a ransom is paid. The victim organization is rendered
    partially or totally unable to operate until it pays, but there is no guarantee that payment will result in the necessary decryption key or that the
    decryption key provided will function properly..
    
    Infects: It often spread through phishing emails that contain malicious attachments or through drive-by downloading.
